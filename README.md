This Grade Calculator is a simple web application built using HTML for structure and user interface, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality. 
It allows users to interactively manage and track grades for various learning activities.
Key features include adding activities with assigned weights, inputting grades for specific activities identified by their number, and deleting the most recently added activity.
The application incorporates basic input validation to ensure data integrity and dynamically updates an on-screen table to reflect the entered and managed information, providing a real-time view of the grade tracking process.
I created this code with the help of chatgpt.
